Princeton Algorithms - Assignment Solutions
================================

Solutions to the programming assignments from the Coursera MOOC: Algorithms, [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms) and [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-data-structures-algorithms-2) by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick.

Each assignment is solved in chronological order has is organized into its own Netbeans project. Each project may have multiple run configurations, which you can access via _run > Set Project Configuration_.

If you intend to use Netbeans as well, I recommend installing the [checkstyle](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/3413/checkstyle-beans) and [findbugs](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/code-inspect.html#fb) plugin. They are used in evaluating your assignments.
